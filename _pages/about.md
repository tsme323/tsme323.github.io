Hello! I am a second-year master's student in **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** remote sensing at **[Sejong University](https://www.sejong.ac.kr/)**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Sangwan Kim**](https://home.sejong.ac.kr/~swkim/). Currently, I am also collaborating with [**Prof. Jinha Jung**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=222078) at **Purdue University** as a visiting scholar.

My research interests include **Interferometric SAR (InSAR)**, **amplitude-based change detection**, and **deep learning-based phase unwrapping**. I am particularly focused on advanced **phase linking techniques** for multi-temporal InSAR applications.

In the past, I have conducted research on a wide range of topics, including:

- Amplitude-based ship detection  
- Change detection performance comparison based on land cover classification  
- Deep learning-based phase unwrapping using U-Net  
- Performance evaluation of sequential phase estimators depending on mini-stack size  
- DEM super-resolution using LiDAR and machine learning  
- Ghost detection in Kompsat-5 SAR imagery  
- 3D building height regression using LiDAR, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2  
- Wildfire damage monitoring using multi-temporal InSAR analysis  
- Non-local weighted sequential optimization for time-series InSAR phase enhancement

Between my third and fourth semesters, I worked as a visiting scholar at Purdue University, which strengthened my ability to communicate in English and collaborate with people from diverse cultural backgrounds.
